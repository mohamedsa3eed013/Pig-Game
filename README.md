# Pig-Game
Pig Game v2 is a web-based version of the classic Pig dice game for two players. Roll the dice to accumulate points, but beware: rolling a 1 ends your turn and resets your current score. Players can choose to hold and add their current score to their total. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game. Play online here.
